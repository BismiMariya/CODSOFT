# KNN Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my **CodSoft Virtual Internship**. It uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Dataset
The dataset consists of measurements of **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model successfully classifies iris flowers with high accuracy using KNN.

## How to Run

#🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project 🚢

Using the Titanic dataset I implemented a Logistic Regression model with Python and Scikit-Learn to predict whether a passenger survived or not. 📊

🔍 What I Did:
✅ Explored and cleaned the dataset for better accuracy.
✅ Built a binary classification model using Logistic Regression.
✅ Gained hands-on experience in predictive analytics and model evaluation.

A huge thank you to CODSOFT for providing this amazing opportunity to apply and grow my skills in data science and machine learning! 🙌

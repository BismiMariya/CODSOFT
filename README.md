# KNN Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my **CodSoft Virtual Internship**. It uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Dataset
The dataset consists of measurements of **sepal length**, **sepal width**, **petal length**, and **petal width**.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Results
The model successfully classifies iris flowers with high accuracy using KNN.
